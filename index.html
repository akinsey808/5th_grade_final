            I was spreading my borders and learning about myself. I also enjoyed

            my time to look around at what I had inside of me.

             Hula was always important at Wai'alae. In fact, we began learning the Aloha 
        'Oli in the first week of school. I have improved heavily over the years and it is 
        a very useful skill for living in Hawai'i. This skill helped me to become a well-rounded
        individual.

        At Wai'alae 'ukulele was always known. You would make sure to keep you grades up
        in music so 'ukulele was easy. Then, we were always excited for the chance to 
        be recognized for being in 'Ukulele Band. When you finally got to start playing in 4th
        grade we wore the correct shirts and made sure not to forget our binders. This skill
        helped me to be capable of multiple dimesions.

        I first started loving to program when I did Hour Of Code. One hour is not 
        enough! We had Hour of Code acople of times, all of wich I enjoyed but were 
        unchallenging. Which is probably why I was inspired to do this website. Hour of
        Code helped me to become a creative problem solver.

        Gardening was a huge part of my love for nature, especially the butterfly garden
        in kindergarten. We had 'Aina Is and garden parties. We ate the outcomes of 
        our own hard work and watched catepillars grow in the crownflower bush. We had to 
        work together to make it work. Gardening helped me to become collaborative.

        Creativity. It isn't a subject or even an activity. It was a way of thinking.
        The way of letting your mind do its job. It was always subtly taught. Our teachers 
        never told us what to do in math projects. Everything was worked with or as a side
        effect of creativity. This helped me to become socially responsible and self-confident.
